Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Examples
----------------------------------------------------------

As I explore LISP I'm going to be working through some classic texts
about the language. To validate my implementation I'm going to work
through all of the examples used in Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs in lispy and validating that their output is the
same as the examples in the book. This will serve as practical use of
lispy and as unit tests.
